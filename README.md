# ML-2022-fall
Machine learning courses for big data analysis in 2022 fall;


It is an introduction to the field of datamining and machine learning. It focuses on fundamental data mining concepts andtechniques for discovering interesting patterns from data in variousapplications. It emphasizes techniques for developing effective, efficient, andscalable data mining and machine learning tools. For the data mining section,the techniques about data visualization, reduced order modeling, correlationmethods and classification methods will be introduced together with examples.For the machine learning section, the techniques about linear regress, logicalregression, underfitting/overfitting, recommendation system, support vectormachine, and compressed sensing will be introduced with examples. Aftercompletion of this course the student should understand the state of the arttechniques in data mining and machine learning.
